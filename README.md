_**Requirements and Goals of the App**_
The app is designed to help users efficiently manage and track important data such as inventory, events, or daily tasks. Key features include adding, editing, deleting, and viewing items in a grid-based format, secure login functionality, and optional SMS notifications. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly and secure tool tailored to meet individual and small business needs​



_**Screens and Features for a User-Centered UI**_

**Login Page:** Secure access to the app.
**Main Interface:** Features a grid-based display for items, interactive buttons, and headers for easy navigation.
**Key Features:** Add, edit, delete, and view data using intuitive swipe gestures and buttons.
These designs focused on simplicity, accessibility, and modern aesthetics, making them successful in providing a smooth and user-friendly experience​


_**Approach to Coding the App**_

Focused on leveraging AndroidX libraries for backward compatibility.
Used SQLite for robust data management and security.
Modular development was likely employed for features like SMS notifications, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
These strategies can be applied in future projects to maintain compatibility, optimize performance, and enhance scalability​


_**Testing Processes and Their Importance**_
The app underwent testing across multiple devices and Android versions, including beta testing with platforms like Sauce Labs and Google Play Console. This process ensures functional reliability, identifies usability issues, and secures user trust. It highlighted areas for improvement and verified that the app performs as intended under various conditions​
